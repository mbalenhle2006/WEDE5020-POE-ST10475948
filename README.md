Introduction and Background of Green Harvest NPO:
Green Harvest NPO is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting sustainable agriculture, food security, and community empowerment. Founded with the vision of building greener, healthier communities, Green Harvest partners with local farmers, schools, and underserved areas to provide education, tools, and support for sustainable farming. The organization believes that everyone has the right to access fresh, nutritious food, and that teaching people how to grow their own food creates lasting change.
Green Harvest's initiatives include community gardens, training programs, and environmental awareness campaigns aimed at combating hunger, reducing poverty, and promoting eco-friendly practices. Its mission is grounded in sustainability, collaboration, and social upliftment, ensuring a better future for both people and the planet.
Homepage Summary
The homepage of Green Harvest NPO presents a clean, modern layout using embedded CSS. It features a header with the organization’s name and a navigation menu linking to Home, About Us, Programs, Contact, and Donate. A visually impactful hero section with a background image delivers a strong donation call-to-action. Below, the mission section outlines the organization’s goals, while the programs section introduces key initiatives—training, gardens, and a support fund—each styled in card format. A final call-to-action invites visitors to get involved. The page is fully responsive and styled for clarity and engagement.
About Us Page
The "About Us" page uses a clean, welcoming design with internal CSS and consistent branding. It begins with a header and navigation bar. The main content sits within a centred, white-background container featuring padded, rounded corners and soft shadows. The “Who We Are” section introduces the organization’s focus on sustainable farming and empowerment. “Our Vision” shares its goal of food access through sustainable practices, while “Our Impact” highlights successes in farmer support and garden projects. A call-to-action button encourages further exploration. The footer includes contact info and social media links.
Programs Page
The "Programs" page reflects an eco-friendly theme, styled with a green palette and clean layout. A central <div> labelled “programs” showcases initiatives using padding, rounded corners, and a box-shadow effect for visual depth. A base64-encoded background image is embedded directly in the CSS for fast loading without external files. The internal CSS ensures consistent style, readability, and SEO optimization across devices.
Contact Page
The "Contact" page features a full-screen background image and a clean white content section with centred text. It includes a styled contact form using the mailto: method to collect name, email, and message. The layout uses modern CSS for readability and responsiveness. A consistent footer provides contact details and social media links.
Donate Page
The "Donate" page encourages giving with a simple, green-themed design. It includes a form collecting username, email, donation amount (minimum R10), and preferred payment method (Credit Card, PayPal, Bank Transfer). A JavaScript snippet redirects to a “Thank You” page after submission. The page ensures accessibility and usability, with a footer matching the site’s overall design
